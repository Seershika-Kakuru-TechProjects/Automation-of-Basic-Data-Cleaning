App title: Basic Data Cleaning Automation App<br>
App URL: https://automation-of-basic-data-cleaning-qmhw72qjxqyga3dpjsbxbe.streamlit.app/

This is a streamlit app that I made to automate some basic data cleaning tasks on excel/csv files.Instead of writing a lot of data cleaning code for every data science/data analysis project, one could easily use operations on this simple app for initial preprocessing.

Operations part of the app:
- remove duplicate rows

Operations after selecting a specific column:<br><br>
For a categorical column:
- Handling missing values
- Converting the column into a different datatype
- Removing whitespace
- Converting column to uppercase or lowercase
- Replacing a substring with another substring
- Performing one-hot-encoding

For a numerical column:
- Handling missing values
- Removing outliers
